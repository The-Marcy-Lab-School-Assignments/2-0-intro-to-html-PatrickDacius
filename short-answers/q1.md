# Question
What's the difference between "semantic" and "non-semantic" elements?

# Answer
Semanatic elements are tags that define the meaning of the content that they hold. Non-semantic elements do not define any meaning of the content, they simply just hold them.

2/3. You can go further by saying "non-semantic tags are used for grouping elements". Just tryna push your descriptions further fam. Being able to explicitly describe these concepts with pure distinctions is what's going to push your technical communication forward. This is a great skill to focus on to build your technical fluency and get ready for real interviews one day.
